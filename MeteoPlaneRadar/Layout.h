//  MeteoPlaneRadar
//  Layout - shared screen bands and a collision check, so no two elements can
//  ever end up drawn on top of each other.
//
//  The round panel has little usable height at top and bottom, and five screens
//  compete for it. Tuning coordinates by hand looks fine until someone enables
//  one more thing, so there are two mechanisms instead:
//
//  1) FIXED BANDS (the LY_* constants). Every screen puts the same kind of
//     information on the same line. The clock is always at LY_STATUS, the range
//     always at LY_RANGE. Two screens cannot disagree about where something
//     goes, and the self-test below proves the bands themselves do not overlap.
//
//  2) RUNTIME CLAIMS. Chrome is RESERVED before the map is drawn. Anything
//     positioned by data - city labels, aircraft callsigns - must then CLAIM
//     its rectangle and is dropped if the space is taken. Priority is draw
//     order: half a callsign under the legend is worse than no callsign.
