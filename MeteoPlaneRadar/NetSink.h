// =============================================================================
//  MeteoPlaneRadar
//  Two ways of reading an HTTP body, both over HTTPClient::writeToStream().
//
//  Why this exists
//  ---------------
//  Every body used to be read by hand off http.getStreamPtr(). That pointer is
//  the RAW socket: it does NOT strip Transfer-Encoding: chunked. When adsb.fi
//  moved behind a proxy that answers chunked, the hex block sizes stayed in the
//  buffer, so the body began "2f8a\r\n{"ac":[" - ArduinoJson read that leading
//  hex as a number, returned Ok, and the document had no "ac" at all. Nothing
//  logged an error, because on its own terms nothing had failed.
//
//  writeToStream() decodes chunked correctly but needs somewhere to put the
//  bytes, and getString() would put the whole body on the heap that TLS draws
//  from. The two sinks doing the work live in NetSink.cpp; nothing outside needs
//  to see them. They also carry the guards writeToStream() has not got: a
//  capacity limit that is reported instead of silently truncating, and a
//  wall-clock budget, because writeToStreamDataBlock() spins on delay(1) with no
//  timeout of its own.

// Scan an already-issued GET without storing it - for bodies that are searched
// rather than kept. The CHMU directory listing is the case that needs it: it has
// no useful upper bound, so any buffer reserved for it is a ceiling waiting to
// be hit. cb gets a NUL-terminated window carrying the tail of the previous one,
// so a token shorter than NET_SCAN_MAX_TOKEN always arrives whole - and, because
// the windows overlap, may arrive twice. Callbacks have to tolerate that.
// Returns the byte count, or -1 on failure.

// PSRAM cannot be used for it). Starting one with less fails deep inside
// mbedTLS and surfaces as a bare "HTTP -1", so callers check first and skip the
// poll, leaving the previous data on screen.
