//  One place for "fetch this URL over TLS and hand me the body".
//
//  Every endpoint in this project needs the same four things: a check that
//  there is enough internal RAM for the handshake, an insecure TLS client
//  (we do not pin certificates - see the note in Outside.h), the response as a
//  complete string rather than a stream, and the "Date" header fed to the clock
//  on the way past. Repeating that in five modules is how they drift apart.

// A TLS handshake needs ~45 kB of internal RAM, which the device does not
// reliably have while the web server is running - so a burst of one handshake
// per radar tile ended up with tiles refused by the heap guard and drawn black.
// Between Begin and End, Net_GetBinary reuses a single connection. Always pair
// them: an open session holds its buffers until closed.
